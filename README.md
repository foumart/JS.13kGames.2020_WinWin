Brief game Description: In WinWin you control a spaceship and fight alien invaders. Each time you destroy an enemy you fix a bad sector from the harddrive. Some files from the game itself are missing too, so you have to search tenaciously in order to find the missing data. When you do so, a new spaceship will be unloacked, giving you the oportunity to try a new weapon.

Controls: [Arrow Keys] [A] [D] Movement

The game was inspired by the famous Lose/Lose game that randomly deletes files from the player's machine.
